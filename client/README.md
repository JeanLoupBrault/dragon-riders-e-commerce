# Frontend

I added a new-component dependecy. In the terminal, in /client, when you type yarn new-component [componenent-name], it will create that new component basic skeleton. I can't get it to work like in the previous workshop with just yarn nc [omponenent-name] yet.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
